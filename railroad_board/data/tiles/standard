<std>   # This expansions identifier which can be used to refer
        # to tiles from this expansion outside this expansion.
        # 
        # If used, must be first line. Leave empty to have same 
        # identifier as file name. Can also be left out completely
        # and the identifier will also be the file name.

TYPES { # Types a tile can have
    E   # Empty type

    G
# More types *cannot* be added to this expansion
}

TILES { # Tiles that are included in this expansion
# Tiles have the following structure:
#
#   <identifier> id: type, (north, east, south, west), station1 station2
#
# The stations determine if the first and second inner networks in the tile
# has a station or not, S denotes a station and _ denotes a lack of one.
# 
# The id decides which inner network the tile has, the type signifies
# what is on the tile and the cardinal directions signify what type of
# road the tile has in that direction.
#
# The identifier is used to build the dice that belong to this expansion.
# An identifier can be accessed outside this file by writing the name
# of the expansion and the identifier in the expansion. I.e. std_a
# or std_f.
