EXTRA: # Extra types
E      # Empty type
# More types *cannot* be added to this expansion

TILES: # Tiles that are included in this expansion
# Tiles have the following structure:
#
#   <identifier> id: type, (north, east, south, west), station
#
# An S is added to the last part of the tile if it contains a station.
# The id decides which inner network the tile has, the type signifies
# what is on the tile and the cardinal directions signify what type of
# road the tile has in that direction.
#
# The identifier is used to build the dice that belong to this expansion.
# An identifier can be accessed outside this file by writing the name
# of the expansion and the identifier in the expansion. I.e. standard_A
# or standard_F.
